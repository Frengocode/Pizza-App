Pizza Apps or Order System Yes, you can call it whatever you want. This app is most similar to an ordering system, What you can do: You can create a product, delete, change, get a product, get all products, you can get products by its category For example, I want to Get All National Products, and you can add products to the Cart and you can remove products from the cart. And now the most important thing is the Order Creation System. How it works you order a product after you order the product you will receive the order status, there are 3 statuses, 1 status is Pending, 2 status in progress is when the order has already been accepted 3 status Ready after the order status is ready then you can pick up your order, you go to the cashier and say that your order was ready and would like to pick up the order,  You pay for the order and the cashier changes the status to Paid and after that the order is closed, but in the future you can see all your orders
